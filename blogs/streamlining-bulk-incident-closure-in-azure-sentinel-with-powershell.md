# Streamlining Bulk Incident Closure in Azure Sentinel with PowerShell


## Introduction
In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital landscape, security incidents are inevitable. To effectively manage and respond to these incidents, having the right tools and processes in place is crucial. Azure Sentinel, Microsoft‚Äôs cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution, offers powerful capabilities for detecting, investigating, and responding to security threats. In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore how to streamline bulk incident closure in Azure Sentinel using a simple PowerShell command.


## Managing Incidents with PowerShell
One of the key features of Azure Sentinel is its ability to automatically detect and create incidents based on predefined detection rules. However, managing these incidents manually can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of them. Thankfully, PowerShell provides a convenient way to automate repetitive tasks, such as closing multiple incidents with a single command.

The PowerShell command we‚Äôll be using is as follows:


```kql
Get-AzSentinelIncident -ResourceGroupName "XXXX" -workspaceName "XXXX"  | Where-Object {$_.Title -eq "Enter the Analytical Rule Name Here"} | ForEach-Object {Update-AzSentinelIncident -Id $_.Name -ResourceGroupName "XXXX"  -WorkspaceName "XXXX"  -SubscriptionId "XXXX"  -Status Closed -Confirm:$false -Severity Medium -Classification Undetermined -Title $_.title}
```
- Update-AzSentinelIncident: This cmdlet updates the status of the incident to ‚ÄúClosed‚Äù and other optional parameters like severity and classification. Make sure to replace ‚ÄúXXXX‚Äù with your actual resource group, workspace, and subscription IDs.

## Benefits of Automation
By leveraging PowerShell automation, you can significantly reduce the time and effort required to manage incidents in Azure Sentinel. This command allows you to quickly close multiple incidents that meet specific criteria, freeing up valuable time for your security team to focus on more critical tasks, such as threat analysis and response.


## Conclusion
In this blog post, we‚Äôve demonstrated how to streamline bulk incident closure in Azure Sentinel using a simple PowerShell command. By automating the process of closing incidents based on their title, you can improve operational efficiency and better utilize your resources. As you continue to explore Azure Sentinel‚Äôs capabilities, don‚Äôt hesitate to leverage automation to optimize your security operations.

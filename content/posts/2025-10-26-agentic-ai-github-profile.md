# How I Used Agentic AI to Automatically Build My GitHub Profile from My Website

In this post, I'll share how I leveraged agentic AI to automatically build and update my GitHub profile using content from my personal website. This automation saved me significant time and ensured my GitHub profile stays in sync with my website.

## The Challenge

Maintaining consistency across multiple online profiles can be tedious. I wanted my GitHub profile to reflect the same information as my website without manually copying and updating content.

## The Solution: Agentic AI

I implemented an agentic AI system that:

1. **Scrapes Content**: Automatically extracts relevant information from my website
2. **Formats Data**: Converts the content into GitHub-compatible markdown
3. **Updates Profile**: Pushes the changes to my GitHub profile repository

## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Content Extraction

The AI agent navigates to my website and identifies key sections:
- About me
- Skills and expertise
- Recent projects
- Blog posts

### Step 2: Content Transformation

Using natural language processing, the agent:
- Formats headings and sections appropriately
- Converts HTML to markdown
- Optimizes content for GitHub's README display

### Step 3: Automated Updates

The agent:
- Commits changes to the repository
- Creates meaningful commit messages
- Handles merge conflicts if necessary

## Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Eliminates manual updates
- **Consistency**: Ensures profile stays current
- **Automation**: Runs on a schedule without intervention

## Lessons Learned

1. Agentic AI can handle complex, multi-step workflows
2. Proper error handling is crucial for reliable automation
3. Regular testing ensures the system adapts to website changes

## Conclusion

Agentic AI has transformed how I manage my online presence. This automation demonstrates the power of AI agents in handling routine but important tasks.

## The Challenge

For the longest time, my GitHub profile README was a static placeholder—a simple "Hello World" that never changed. Meanwhile, my blog at [SecByte.in](https://secbyte.in) was constantly evolving with new technical articles, tutorials, and insights about cybersecurity and AI. The disconnect between these two platforms bothered me. Why couldn't my GitHub profile automatically reflect the latest from my blog?

I wanted a solution that would:

- Automatically sync my latest blog posts to my GitHub profile
- Keep my GitHub presence fresh without manual updates
- Showcase my work dynamically to visitors

But manually updating my GitHub profile every time I published a new blog post? That wasn't sustainable. I needed automation—and that's where Agentic AI came in.

## What is Agentic AI?

Before diving into the solution, let's clarify what Agentic AI actually means.

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that can act autonomously on behalf of users—making decisions, taking actions, and completing tasks without constant human intervention. Unlike traditional AI that simply responds to queries, agentic AI can:

- Navigate websites and interact with web interfaces
- Make intelligent decisions based on context
- Execute complex multi-step workflows
- Adapt to unexpected situations

Think of it as having a digital assistant that doesn't just answer questions but actually *does things* for you.

## The Solution: Enter Perplexity Comet

I decided to use **Perplexity Comet**, an agentic AI browser assistant that can navigate websites, extract information, and execute tasks autonomously. My plan was simple in concept but powerful in execution:

1. Use Comet to scrape my blog's main page
2. Extract the latest posts with titles and links
3. Generate markdown-formatted content
4. Automatically update my GitHub profile README

Here's how I made it happen.

---

## Step 1: Scraping the Blog Content

First, I instructed Comet to navigate to my blog at https://secbyte.in and extract all post titles and their corresponding URLs. The AI agent:

- Loaded the website
- Identified blog post elements
- Extracted title text and URLs
- Organized the data into a structured format

The beauty of using Agentic AI here is that it understood the website structure without me having to write custom scraping code or deal with HTML parsing.

---

## Step 2: Formatting the Content

Next, I needed the content in markdown format suitable for GitHub. I prompted Comet to:

- Format each blog post as a markdown list item
- Include post titles as clickable links
- Organize posts chronologically
- Add proper markdown syntax (headers, links, etc.)

The AI agent handled all the formatting automatically, creating clean, GitHub-ready markdown.

---

## Step 3: Updating the GitHub Profile

This is where it got really interesting. I directed Comet to:

1. Navigate to my GitHub profile repository
2. Open the README.md file
3. Replace the old content with the newly formatted blog posts
4. Commit the changes with an appropriate commit message

The Agentic AI navigated GitHub's interface, made the edits, and committed the changes—all autonomously.

---

## The Result

Now, my GitHub profile README dynamically showcases my latest blog posts. Anyone visiting my profile can immediately see:

- My most recent technical articles
- Direct links to read full posts
- An up-to-date representation of my work

Best of all? The entire process can be automated to run periodically, keeping my GitHub profile perpetually fresh.

---

## Why This Matters

This experiment demonstrates the power of Agentic AI beyond simple chatbots:

1. **Automation of Complex Workflows**: Instead of writing custom scripts or using multiple tools, one AI agent handled everything
2. **No Coding Required**: The entire process was accomplished through natural language instructions
3. **Adaptive Problem-Solving**: The AI navigated unexpected elements and handled website structure intelligently
4. **Time Savings**: What would have taken hours of manual work or script development happened in minutes

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained some valuable insights:

- **Clear Instructions Matter**: The more specific your prompts to the AI agent, the better the results
- **Verification is Key**: While Agentic AI is powerful, always verify the output, especially for public-facing content
- **Iterative Refinement**: I refined my approach several times, learning what worked best with the AI agent

---

## The Future of Agentic AI

This experiment is just scratching the surface. Agentic AI has potential applications in:

- Automated content management across platforms
- Dynamic portfolio updates
- Cross-platform content synchronization
- Automated reporting and documentation

As these AI agents become more sophisticated, we'll see them handling increasingly complex workflows with minimal human intervention.

---

## Conclusion

By leveraging Agentic AI through Perplexity Comet, I transformed my static GitHub profile into a dynamic showcase of my latest work—without writing a single line of code. This is the promise of Agentic AI: making complex automation accessible through natural language, allowing us to focus on creativity rather than implementation details.

If you're interested in trying this yourself, start by identifying repetitive tasks in your workflow and experiment with agentic AI tools. You might be surprised at what becomes possible.

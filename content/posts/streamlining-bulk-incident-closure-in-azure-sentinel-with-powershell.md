# Streamlining Bulk Incident Closure in Azure Sentinel with¬†PowerShell


## Introduction

In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital landscape, security incidents are inevitable. To effectively manage and respond to these incidents, having the right tools and processes in place is crucial. Azure Sentinel, Microsoft‚Äôs cloud-native SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution, offers powerful capabilities for detecting, investigating, and responding to security threats. In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore how to streamline bulk incident closure in Azure Sentinel using a simple PowerShell command.


## Managing Incidents with PowerShell

One of the key features of Azure Sentinel is its ability to automatically detect and create incidents based on predefined detection rules. However, managing these incidents manually can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with a large number of them. Thankfully, PowerShell provides a convenient way to automate repetitive tasks, such as closing multiple incidents with a single command.

The PowerShell command we‚Äôll be using is as follows:


``````


#### Let‚Äôs break down what this command does:

- Get-AzSentinelIncident: This cmdlet retrieves all incidents from Azure Sentinel within the specified resource group and workspace.
- Where-Object: We use this cmdlet to filter the incidents based on their title. Replace ‚ÄúEnter the Analytical Rule Name Here‚Äù with the specific name of the analytical rule associated with the incidents you want to close.
- ForEach-Object: For each incident that matches the specified title, we execute the following actions:Update-AzSentinelIncident: This cmdlet updates the status of the incident to ‚ÄúClosed‚Äù and other optional parameters like severity and classification. Make sure to replace ‚ÄúXXXX‚Äù with your actual resource group, workspace, and subscription IDs.

- Update-AzSentinelIncident: This cmdlet updates the status of the incident to ‚ÄúClosed‚Äù and other optional parameters like severity and classification. Make sure to replace ‚ÄúXXXX‚Äù with your actual resource group, workspace, and subscription IDs.


## Benefits of Automation

By leveraging PowerShell automation, you can significantly reduce the time and effort required to manage incidents in Azure Sentinel. This command allows you to quickly close multiple incidents that meet specific criteria, freeing up valuable time for your security team to focus on more critical tasks, such as threat analysis and response.


## Conclusion

In this blog post, we‚Äôve demonstrated how to streamline bulk incident closure in Azure Sentinel using a simple PowerShell command. By automating the process of closing incidents based on their title, you can improve operational efficiency and better utilize your resources. As you continue to explore Azure Sentinel‚Äôs capabilities, don‚Äôt hesitate to leverage automation to optimize your security operations.

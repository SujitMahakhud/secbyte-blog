# How to Configure Azure Blob Storage as a Terraform Remote Backend

## 🎯 Introduction

If you're using Terraform to deploy resources in Azure, you've probably seen a file called `terraform.tfstate` in your project folder.

This file **keeps track of everything Terraform creates**, acting as its "memory."

By default, this state file is stored **locally**, which is okay if you're working alone on a test environment. But in real projects—especially with a team—this is **risky**.

This guide will walk you step by step through **storing Terraform state remotely in Azure Blob Storage**, so your state file is:

✅ **Secure**  
✅ **Shared**  
✅ **Automatically locked** to prevent conflicts

Even if you are a **complete beginner** in Terraform or Azure, just follow along carefully.

---

## ✨ What is Terraform State?

Terraform state is simply a **JSON file** where Terraform records:

- What resources it created
- Their configuration
- Metadata like IDs, names, and properties

Whenever you run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`, Terraform reads this file to understand what it previously deployed and what changed.

**If you delete this file or it gets out of sync, Terraform loses track of your resources.**

---

## 🚨 Why Local State is a Problem

### Issues with Local State:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Accidental deletion** | If your laptop crashes or you delete the file, your infrastructure tracking is lost |
| **No collaboration** | Teammates can't see your state |
| **Risky secrets** | The state often includes sensitive information (like passwords or connection strings) |
| **No locking** | Multiple people can modify infrastructure simultaneously, causing conflicts |
| **No backup** | Lost state means lost infrastructure tracking |

✅ That's why professionals **use remote backends** to store state safely.

---

## 🟢 What is a Remote Backend?

A backend is simply **where Terraform stores its state file**.

### Using Azure Blob Storage as Your Backend Provides:

✅ **Shared access** for teams  
✅ Automatic **state locking** (to prevent corruption)  
✅ **Encryption at rest**  
✅ Easy **backup and recovery**  
✅ **Version history** of state files  
✅ **Role-based access control** (RBAC)

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

- Azure subscription (free tier works!)
- [Azure CLI installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Terraform installed](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- Basic understanding of Terraform
- PowerShell or Terminal access

---

## ✨ Step 1: Create Azure Storage for Terraform State

You'll need:
- ✅ A Resource Group
- ✅ A Storage Account
- ✅ A Blob Container

Open **PowerShell** or your terminal, and log in:

```bash
az login
```

### 📌 Create a Resource Group

```bash
az group create --name rg-terraform-state --location southcentralus
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a logical container for your storage resources
- Located in South Central US region (you can change this to your preferred region)

---

### 📌 Create a Storage Account

**Important:** Storage account names **must be globally unique** and can only contain lowercase letters and numbers.

In this example, replace `mytfstatestorage123` with your own unique name.

```bash
az storage account create \
  --name mytfstatestorage123 \
  --resource-group rg-terraform-state \
  --sku Standard_LRS \
  --encryption-services blob \
  --https-only true
```

**Parameters explained:**
- `--name`: Your globally unique storage account name
- `--sku Standard_LRS`: Locally redundant storage (cost-effective)
- `--encryption-services blob`: Encrypts blob data at rest
- `--https-only true`: Enforces secure connections

---

### 📌 Create a Blob Container

```bash
az storage container create \
  --name tfstate \
  --account-name mytfstatestorage123
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a container named "tfstate" to hold your state files
- Think of it as a folder within your storage account

---

## ✨ Step 2: Configure Terraform Backend

In your Terraform project folder, create a file called **`backend.tf`**.

Paste this configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "rg-terraform-state"
    storage_account_name = "mytfstatestorage123"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

### ✅ Configuration Breakdown:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `resource_group_name` | The resource group you created |
| `storage_account_name` | Your storage account name |
| `container_name` | The container for storing state |
| `key` | The blob name (think of this as the filename) |

---

## 🔐 Authentication Options

✅ **Important:** Do **NOT** hard-code credentials in this file.

Terraform can authenticate using:

### Option 1: Azure CLI (Easiest)

```bash
az login
```

Terraform automatically uses your Azure CLI credentials.

### Option 2: Environment Variable with Access Key

#### 📌 Retrieve the Storage Account Key

```powershell
$accountKey = (az storage account keys list `
  --resource-group rg-terraform-state `
  --account-name mytfstatestorage123 `
  --query "[0].value" `
  --output tsv)
```

#### 📌 Set the Environment Variable

```powershell
$env:ARM_ACCESS_KEY = $accountKey
```

This tells Terraform to use this key **without storing it in code**.

### Option 3: Service Principal (Recommended for CI/CD)

Create a service principal and use these environment variables:

```bash
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="<service-principal-app-id>"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="<service-principal-password>"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="<tenant-id>"
```

---

## ✨ Step 3: Initialize Terraform

Run:

```bash
terraform init
```

### What Happens:

Terraform will:
- ✅ Detect your backend configuration
- ✅ Prompt you to migrate any local state
- ✅ Store state remotely in Azure

### ✅ Example Prompt:

```
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.
```

✅ Type **`yes`** to migrate your existing local state.

---

## ✨ Step 4: Apply Your Terraform Code

Run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

Review the changes, then:

```bash
terraform apply
```

### What Happens:

Terraform will:
- ✅ Create any resources defined in your configuration
- ✅ Save your state **in Azure Blob Storage**
- ✅ Automatically lock the state during operations

### 📸 Verification:

You can view your state file in the Azure Portal:
1. Navigate to **Storage Accounts**
2. Select your storage account
3. Go to **Containers** → **tfstate**
4. You'll see `prod.terraform.tfstate` blob

---

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### ✔ Never Hard-Code Keys

Don't put access keys or secrets directly in `.tf` files. Use:
- Azure CLI authentication
- Environment variables
- Service principals
- Managed identities

### ✔ Restrict Access to Storage Account

Use **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:

```bash
az role assignment create \
  --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" \
  --assignee <user-email-or-principal-id> \
  --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/rg-terraform-state
```

### ✔ Network Security

Restrict access with:
- **Firewall rules**: Allow specific IP addresses
- **Private Endpoints**: Access storage through private network
- **Virtual Network Service Endpoints**

### ✔ Version Control

Never commit these to Git:
- `terraform.tfstate` files
- `.terraform/` directory
- Credentials or access keys

Add to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*
.terraform/
*.tfvars
```

### ✔ Enable Soft Delete

Protect against accidental deletion:

```bash
az storage blob service-properties delete-policy update \
  --account-name mytfstatestorage123 \
  --enable true \
  --days-retained 30
```

## 🧠 Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I have multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)?

**Yes!** Simply change the `key` parameter:

#### Development environment:
```hcl
key = "dev.terraform.tfstate"
```

#### Staging environment:
```hcl
key = "stage.terraform.tfstate"
```

#### Production environment:
```hcl
key = "prod.terraform.tfstate"
```

Or organize by folder structure:

```hcl
key = "environments/dev/terraform.tfstate"
```

### Q: What happens if two people run `terraform apply` simultaneously?

Azure Blob Storage provides **automatic state locking**. The second person will see:

```
Error: Error locking state: Error acquiring the state lock
```

They must wait until the first operation completes.

### Q: How do I migrate existing local state?

When you run `terraform init` after configuring the backend, Terraform will prompt you:

```
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
```

Type `yes` to migrate automatically.

### Q: Can I use Azure Storage for other Terraform providers (AWS, GCP)?

**Yes!** The backend configuration is provider-agnostic. You can manage AWS resources while storing state in Azure.

### Q: How much does Azure Blob Storage cost?

Very minimal! For typical Terraform state files:
- Storage: ~$0.02/GB/month
- Transactions: Minimal cost for read/write operations
- Most projects cost less than $1/month

# How to Create an Azure Resource Group Using Terraform — A Beginner’s Guide

If you’re new to Terraform and Azure, getting started can feel a little overwhelming. But don’t worry — creating your first Azure Resource Group with Terraform is simpler than you think! In this guide, I’ll walk you through the exact steps to set up your environment and deploy a resource group on Azure using Terraform.

Let’s jump right in! 🚀


## What Is Terraform & Why Use It?

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. It lets you write code to create, manage, and update cloud resources — like virtual machines, storage accounts, and resource groups — instead of clicking through a web portal.

Using Terraform means your infrastructure is version-controlled, repeatable, and easy to share or modify. It’s a game-changer for beginners and pros alike.


## Prerequisites Before We Begin

To follow along, make sure you have:

- AnAzure account(a free tier works just fine)
- Terraform installedon your machine (download from terraform.io)
- Azure CLI installed(optional but helpful for authentication)
- AService Principalin Azure with appropriate permissions — this acts like a user Terraform uses to authenticate with Azure securely


## Step 1: Set Up Your Azure Service Principal

You can create a Service Principal — which acts like a “robot user” for Terraform — using the Azure Portal:


``````

That’s it! Now you have the details needed to authenticate Terraform with Azure.


## Step 2: Write Your Terraform Configuration


``````


``````


``````


## Step 3: Initialize Terraform

Open your terminal (or PowerShell) and navigate to your Terraform project folder. Run:


``````

This downloads the Azure provider and prepares Terraform to work with your configuration.


## Step 4: Apply Your Configuration

Now you’re ready to create the resource group! Run:


``````


``````


## Step 5: Verify Your Resource Group in Azure

Once Terraform finishes, head over to theAzure Portaland check underResource Groups. You should see your new resource group created exactly where you specified it — “West Europe” in this example!


## Bonus: Using Environment Variables for Security

Hardcoding sensitive information like your client secret in code can be risky. Instead, you can set environment variables on your machine like this:

On PowerShell:


``````


``````


``````

Terraform will automatically pick up the values from your environment variables. This keeps secrets out of your code — a best practice for every Terraform project!


## Wrapping Up

And there you have it — your very first Azure Resource Group created using Terraform! 🎉

Terraform lets you manage your cloud infrastructure with code, which means no more manual clicks, fewer mistakes, and a path to automation and scalability.

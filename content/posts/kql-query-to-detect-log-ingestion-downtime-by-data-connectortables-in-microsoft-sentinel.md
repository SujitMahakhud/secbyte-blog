# KQL Query to Detect Log Ingestion Downtime by data connector/tables in MicrosoftÂ Sentinel


## Introduction

In a cybersecurity environment, timely detection of anomalies or issues in log ingestion is critical for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of your security operations. Microsoft Sentinel offers a powerful platform for managing and analyzing security logs, but itâ€™s equally important to have mechanisms in place to detect and address any downtime or delays in log ingestion. In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore a Key Query Language (KQL) query designed to help you detect log ingestion downtime by data connectors and their respective tables in Microsoft Sentinel.


## Value Proposition

The query is a must-have for all Microsoft Sentinel implementations. It addresses the critical need for timely detection of log ingestion issues, ensuring logs from essential sources are ingested promptly. With its comprehensive monitoring and proactive alerting capabilities, itâ€™s indispensable for efficiently managing security risks and responding swiftly to threats.

- Timely Detection: Quickly identifies if logs from critical sources like Windows Security Events or Syslog are delayed.
- Comprehensive Monitoring: Monitors multiple data connectors for a complete view of log ingestion status.
- Customizable and Scalable: Can be easily adjusted to monitor new data connectors and adapt to changing needs.

The above will give you the result like below mentioned screenshot:


## Visualization

The above KQL query can be leveraged to visualize the log downtime through workbooks and dashboards.

Visualizing the log ingestion status through a workbook provides a clear and intuitive way to monitor the health of data connectors in Microsoft Sentinel. It offers a quick overview of the last seen times for each data connector, highlighting any potential delays or issues in log ingestion.


## Conclusion

In summary, the KQL query offers a solid foundation for monitoring log ingestion in Microsoft Sentinel, providing vital insights into data connector status. When combined with visual workbooks, these insights are enhanced, offering clear and intuitive representations of log ingestion health. Together, they empower organizations to proactively manage security operations, ensuring timely detection and resolution of any issues, thus bolstering overall cybersecurity defenses.

> Share what you know, and the world will open doors you never imagined

What started as a simple desire to share knowledge turned into a side income that I never expected. I began my blogging journey by writing technical blogs on cybersecurityâ€”primarily focusing on Microsoft Sentinel and Defender tools. At the time, I had no idea that this passion would eventually lead to multiple job offers and a new stream of income, culminating in my first earnings from my blog post, _From [Machines to Cybersecurity: My Unlikely Journey](https://medium.com/@sujitmahakhud/from-machines-to-cybersecurity-my-unlikely-journey-ced0a8e360a8)_, published on Medium.com

## How It All Started

Initially, I wrote exclusively for my website, [_securebyteblog.com_](https://securebyteblog.com), with the goal of making complex cybersecurity concepts more accessible. Having faced the steep learning curve myself, I wanted to help other professionals who were just starting their careers. My content focused on breaking down practical insights into Microsoft security tools, which I shared to help others navigate these challenges more easily. Eventually, I started posting these blogs on LinkedIn, which quickly gained attention from fellow IT professionals and potential employers.

## A Growing Audience and Unexpected Opportunities

As my LinkedIn audience grew, so did the recognition of my expertise. People started reaching out, not only for advice but also for job offers. Employers saw the depth of knowledge in my blogs, which helped open doors to new opportunities. I was eventually hired by a major MNC, a pivotal moment that highlighted the impact my writing could have on my career.

## The Side Income That Followed

Soon, it wasn't just job offers that started rolling in. I began receiving requests for training on Microsoft security tools, turning my passion into a side income. What started as a way to share knowledge evolved into a profitable venture as I conducted training sessions for professionals looking to deepen their expertise.

## The Thrill of My First Writing Income

The most significant moment in my blogging journey was when I earned my first income purely from writing. My blog post on Medium, [From Machines to Cybersecurity: My Unlikely Journey](https://medium.com/@sujitmahakhud/from-machines-to-cybersecurity-my-unlikely-journey-ced0a8e360a8), not only reached a wide audience but also generated revenue. Seeing my passion for writing translate into financial gain was an incredible feelingâ€”it was the point where I realized my writing wasn't just a hobby but a genuine source of income.

## Final Thoughts

When you share your passion with the world, you create ripples of opportunity that can lead to unexpected rewards. The act of sharing knowledge not only enriches others but also paves the way for personal growth and success. Remember, the true value of your contributions lies not just in financial gain, but in the impact you have on those around you. Embrace your passion, and you may inspire others to pursue their dreams, creating a cycle of positivity and possibility.
